**Existing customers**
Incremental spend = Difference in uplift in daily spend from pre period to offer period for redeemers vs non-redeemers

**New customers**
Incremental spend = Difference in daily spend in offer period for redeemers vs non-redeemers

### 2. Retention of existing customers: Has the offer retained customers?
Incremental customers = Difference in % of existing customers from offer period that transacted in post period (or X weeks after offer transaction) for redeemers vs non redeemers. How many of the retention pot does this make up?
Value over projected avg lifecycle MINUS the incremental spend already accounted for in existing customers.
