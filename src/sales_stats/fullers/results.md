## Summary 

- In transactions, the majority of Fullers pubs are identified by their pub name as merchant name 
- The causes problems:
    1) We need to knwo the list of possible Fullers pub names
    2) There are other non-Fullers pubs with the same names across the coutry
- For (1) I found a list of 181 fullers pubs with outdoor space that are opening in April 2021, so thought these would be interesting to look into
- (2) required matching on location to narrow down all pubs called 'The Red Lion', for example, to only those that are the Fuller's Red Lion due to open in April. 
- For all the Fuller's Pubs in my list due to open, I tried to match on name and pub location name with Flux data (e.g. The Red Lion, Ealing)
- This reduced the data to 102 transactions across 51 accounts and 19 Fullers pubs. 
- Doesn't give us much to play with in terms of generating stats! But will give it a go

## Some stats 

Spend amount by pub
- Looking at pubs that we can see have had more than 10 customers, we can look at difference in average spend per transaction
- The pub with the highest ATV is The Anglers in Teddington.  
- No difference is significant 
- In general don't think the numbers allow us to make cross location comparisons, so will look at total metrics

Repeat purchasing over multiple days
- 18% of customers visited a Fuller's pub across multiple days in the past year
*** warning: only based on starling so might have returned using another card ***

Repeat purchasing on same day 
- On average customers make 1.5 transactions when they visit a Fuller's

Customers making repeat purchases on same day spend less with each transaction:
- The average amount spend on transaction 1 is £23.15, based on 51 accounts.
- The average amount spend on transaction 2 is £14.38, based on 21 accounts.
- The average amount spend on transaction 3 is £12.72, based on 10 accounts.
- The average amount spend on transaction 4 is £12.64, based on 6 accounts.

- £10 drop from transaction 1-> 2 but difference is significant (too low volume)
